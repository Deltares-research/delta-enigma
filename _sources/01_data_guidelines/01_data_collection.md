Data Collection Guidelines
========================

This section outlines the essential practices and requirements for data collection within the Delta Enigma project. Understanding and following these guidelines ensures data quality and seamless integration with the Delta Enigma Data Platform.

Input Data Requirement
--------------------

The Delta Enigma Data Platform accepts only clean, properly formatted data. As a researcher, you are responsible for cleaning and preparing your data before submission to the platform.

**Important:** 
* The platform does not provide data cleaning services. Data cleaning must be done prior to upload. 
* All data must be submitted in open, non-proprietary formats to ensure long-term accessibility and reproducibility.

Best Practices
------------

* Maintain a separate copy of raw data
* Document all cleaning procedures
* Use version control for cleaning scripts
* Validate data quality after each cleaning step
* Use open-source tools for data cleaning when possible
* Save data in open formats from the beginning of your research
* Consult with your [Data Steward](../03_general_info/02_data_stewards) when uncertain
