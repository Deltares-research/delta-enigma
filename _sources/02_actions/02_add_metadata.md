# Adding Metadata in Yoda

## Overview

This guide explains how to add metadata to your files in Yoda for the Delta Enigma project. Proper metadata is crucial for making your data findable, accessible, and reusable by other researchers.

## Prerequisites

- Uploaded data to Yoda (see [Uploading Data](01_upload_data.md))
- Access to [SURF Yoda portal](https://deltaenigma-yoda.irods.surfsara.nl/)

## Required Metadata Fields

For the Delta Enigma project, the following metadata fields are mandatory:

- **Title**: A descriptive name for your dataset
- **Description**: Brief explanation of what the data represents
- **Creator**: Name of the person who created the data
- **Collection Date**: When the data was collected
- **Location**: Geographic location where data was collected
- **Instrument**: Device or method used to collect the data
- **Work Package**: The Delta Enigma work package this data belongs to
